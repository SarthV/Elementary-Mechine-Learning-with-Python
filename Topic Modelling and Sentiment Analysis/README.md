#### *The LDA Practice file as the name suggests is just a simple program to understand and implement the idea of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)*
#### *Next, I have tried to use the popular LDA algorithm for topic modelling/ classification on the Amazon musical instruments review datset.*
<br/> Here are again clicks of some of the formulas and the working of LDA that I drew for myself while writing the code. Just leaving them here in case if anyone finds it useful.
