## Sentiment Analysis of Tweets
#### Twitter Sentiment Analysis as the name suggests is just a program to understand and implement the idea of Sentiment Analysis on different tweets.
The training dataset is a set of random tweets classified in two categories i.e Racist/ Sexual tweets and non racist tweets. But before implementing any machine learning algorithm, extensive cleaning of the data was needed and done. Alonng with this different types of models such as a Bag of Words (BOW) model, TF-IDF matrix model, word embedding models such as doc2vec and word2vec etc. were created/ used in order to determine the model with the best accuracy score.<br /><br />
*This mini project is still under progress as I am left with applying these models on different machine learning algorithms. 
Albeit as of now, I plan on using Logistic regression and XG Boost here.*
