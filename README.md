# Machine-Learning-with-Python
This contains few of the code snippets of some of the basic machine learning in Python.

A Sentiment Analysis was done on the IMdB movie reviews dataset, using the simple Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) theorem.
The code uploaded is fully commented and I hope is pretty easy to understand. <br /> *People unfamiliar with the MNB theorem may find these images below, a little helpful so as to understand the probabilty function.*

&nbspThese are some of the formuales that I wrote for myself while completing the code. Hope you may find something in here for yourselves :)
